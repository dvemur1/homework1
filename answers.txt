What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

git merge will merge more than 1 branch without changing the branches themselves. It will tie in the
histories of the branches we merged together. This may cause errors if there are conflicts between the branches.
git rebase will move the target branch to the tip of the selected branch which effectively changes the history of
the project.
